# Image classification Using Transfer Learning 

## Introduction

This study aimed to build image classifiers in the domain of disposable waste images. With this project, I want to understand how to solve an image classification problem through using Transfer Learning. Transfer Learning is usually used in computer vision tasks where only a small amount of data is available. In this project, I’m going to implement a VGG16 model which is a pre-trained network. This model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. I’m going to use this pre-trained architecture as a base model. Then, I will remove the fully connected layers and try different networks to classificate the images into six categories.
